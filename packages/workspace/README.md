## Summary

The workspace family lets a host product keep an ordered list of named projects and group each project's sessions by directory. Users can browse those projects and sessions, hide a session from the grouping without deleting it, and remove a project without deleting its folder or session history. Hidden or removed sessions remain available as ungrouped history. Choose this family for a persistent project surface; it requires session storage and a persistence backend, and it does not expose tools, prompts, or session events to the model.
