# web/ — web access capability family

## Summary

The `web/` packages let models search the public web and fetch HTTP(S) pages through the `web_search` and `web_fetch` tools. Search works with no key through free services; deployments can choose Exa, Perplexity, Brave, Tavily, or DeepSeek instead and anonymous HTTP(S) or DeepSeek for fetch; availability and resource limits depend on the configured provider. Use this family for search and page retrieval, not interactive browsing, content extraction, or per-URL policy enforcement. Models receive consistent tool behavior, cancellation, and error reporting when providers change.

## Packages

Ten packages play the web roles; the subsystem reference owns the exhaustive vocabulary and contracts.

| Package | Role | ctx key |
|---|---|---|
| [`web/`](web/README.md) | Search/fetch service: search and fetch URLs through interchangeable backends, one selection and error policy | `ctx.web` |
| [`web-search-exa/`](web-search-exa/README.md) | Searches the web through Exa | registers on `ctx.web` |
| [`web-search-perplexity/`](web-search-perplexity/README.md) | Searches the web through Perplexity | registers on `ctx.web` |
| [`web-search-brave/`](web-search-brave/README.md) | Searches the web through Brave Search | registers on `ctx.web` |
| [`web-search-tavily/`](web-search-tavily/README.md) | Searches the web through Tavily | registers on `ctx.web` |
| [`web-search-free/`](web-search-free/README.md) | Searches the web through free services that need no key | registers on `ctx.web` |
| [`web-search-deepseek/`](web-search-deepseek/README.md) | Searches through DeepSeek Messages | registers on `ctx.web` |
| [`web-deepseek-api/`](web-deepseek-api/README.md) | Searches and fetches pages through the DeepSeek Search and Fetch APIs | registers on `ctx.web` |

Start with the subsystem reference for the shared vocabulary, then the design decision behind the single provider-selection service.

- Web subsystem — the search/fetch requests and results, provider availability, `WebError`, and the fetch network policy.
- Web capability seam decision — why search and fetch share one provider-selection service.
